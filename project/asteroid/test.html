				The objective of this game is to destroy as many asteroids as possible to get the most point and be in the top 5 players in the highscore page.
				The spaceship automatically shoots at a fixed interval of time. The player can rotate the ship with the bottom left arrows and can move forward the ship with the bottom right arrow.
				Just like the original Asteroids game, going through a side of the game will bring you on the opposite side.
